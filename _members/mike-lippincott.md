Mike Lippincott is a Cell Biology, Stem Cells, and Development (CSD) PhD student at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus.
Mike joined the Way Lab in July 2023 and is looking to understand how cellular morphologies change in the context of cellular stress and how organelle interactions affect cellular states.

Mike earned a B.S. in Biochemistry and Data Science from [Maryville University of Saint Louis](https://www.maryville.edu/) in 2021. Here he conducted research in biochemical pathway manipulations in sugar cane, CRISPR gene editing in non-mendelian genetic plant models, plasma based atomic emission spectroscopy, and cellular transcriptomic investigation of telomerase activating drug TA-65.

After graduating from [Maryville](https://www.maryville.edu/), Mike did his post-baccalaureate training at the [University of North Caroina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) where he developed software to analyze telomeric sequence homology in _[Caenorabditis elegans](http://www.wormbook.org/)_ and Humans. 

Mike finds the unknown depths of science to be the most exciting part of research. Further understanding the unknown and sharing that knowledge with others is what drives him to pursue a career in science. In the age of big data, the opportunity to delve into the unknown is more accessible than ever.

Mike is passionate about collaborative team science and bridging the gap between scientific fields to promote interdisciplinary science. 

Outside of lab you can find Mike rock climbing, snowboarding, 3D printing, photographing nature, or tending to his aquatic pets the _Neocaridina davidi_.
