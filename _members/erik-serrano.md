Erik Serrano is a Computational Bioscience (CPBS) PhD student at the Univeristy of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC).
He joined the Way Lab in July 2022, where he is focusing on developing software applications and new methods to analyze cell morphology readouts.
Before officially joining the Way lab, Erik kick started a software tool called [Cytopipe](https://github.com/WayScience/CytoPipe), which implements reproducible analytical pipelines for processing high-dimensional cell morphology readouts.

Erik obtained his bachelors degree in Molecular Biology with a minor in chemistry at the [California State University, Northirdge (CSUN)](https://www.csun.edu/).
Throughout his undergraduate degree, his research experience mainly pertained to developing computational methods to elucidate biological insights through the usage of protein dynamic data produced by molecular dynamic simulations.
After graduating from CSUN, Erik did his post baccalaureate at [Cedar-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/departments-institutes/biomedical-sciences.html) where his main job was designing viral based nano-particles through the usage of computational protein modeling.
In addition, he also developed computational methods using gene expression data to identify potential alternative entry points where the nano-particles can be introduced.

In his free time, Erik likes to learn different romance languages and its origins.
He is fluent in Spanish and is currently learning Brazilian Portuguese to become his third language.
Aside from learning different languages, Erik also enjoys tech, music, reading, hiking, camping, long boarding, running, weight lifting and dancing.
