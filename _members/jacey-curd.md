Jacey graduated with B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Biology from Duke University, where she worked in Dr. Raluca Gordanâ€™s lab on CRISPR and MutS. In her senior thesis, she focused on the DNA binding specificity of MutS, the primary enzyme responsible for initiating mismatch repair, and possible associations with CRISPR Prime Editing technology, specifically in single base pair edits. 

Jacey joined the Way Lab in July 2024, and is incredibly passionate about researching pediatric oncology, with a focus on computational methods. 

Outside of the lab, Jacey enjoys ballet, salsa, and line dancing, and also helps mentor a FIRST robotics team.
