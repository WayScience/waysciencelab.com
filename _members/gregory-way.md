Greg is the Principal Investigator (PI) of the Way Lab.
He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/biochemistry) and a member of the [Center for Health AI](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ai) in the [School of Medicine at University of Colorado Anschutz](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/).
He sets forward the lab's scientific path of inquiry, acquires funding, and establishes a lab environment where scientists of all backgrounds can flourish.
He is currently interested in developing morphology as a systems biology readout of disease states to link molecular information with higher order phenotypes in order to improve treatment decisions.
He is an optimist who believes that the next generation of biological discoveries will require lots of data, lots of compute, reproducible software, and a lot more diverse people with diverse ideas to forge an equitable and prosperous path forward for humanity.

Before founding the Way Lab in 2021, Greg earned a B.S. in Biology and Environmental Studies from [The College of New Jersey](https://tcnj.edu/) in 2011, and an M.S. in Biology from [Saint Joseph's University](https://www.sju.edu/) in 2014.
In 2018, he earned his Ph.D. in [Genomics and Computational Biology](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) from [The University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) for his research studying applied machine learning to genomic and transcriptomic data.
He later moved to the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) where he worked as a postdoc in the [Imaging Platform](https://www.broadinstitute.org/imaging) from 2018-2021 studying image-based profiling, high-throughput assay development, software engineering, and drug discovery.
Greg's overarching mission is to reduce human suffering through biomedical data science methods and applications.

When not in the lab, he is probably either hanging out with family and friends, playing with his two cats, hiking in the woods, watching the Mets lose, or sipping an IPA.
