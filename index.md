# Biomedical data science

Welcome to the Way Lab at [The University of Colorado Anschutz](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/)!

The mission of our lab is to reduce human suffering by integrating biomedical data science and software engineering into drug discovery.
We develop new computational methods, innovative approaches, assays, and software for analyzing high-dimensional genomic, molecular, and microscopy data.
We focus on pediatric diseases, including pediatric cancer and Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1).

We perform team science with multidisciplinary collaborators to amplify the impact of our computationally-focused work.
We also perform open science, making all of our work immediately open for anyone to use and build upon.
See https://github.com/WayScience for more.
